# Odin-Project-Etch-a-Sketch-
In this project, I will build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
Project Instructions:
Create a 16x16 grid of square divs dynamically using JavaScript.
Organize the grid squares within a "container" div in your HTML file.
Utilize Flexbox to arrange the divs into a grid layout. Avoid CSS Grid.
Implement a hover effect where grid divs change color upon mouseover, resembling a pen trail through the grid.
Utilize event listeners for mouse enter and leave events to trigger the hover effect.
Incorporate a button at the top of the screen to prompt the user for the number of squares per side for a new grid. Upon input, replace the existing grid with a new one while maintaining the overall dimensions (e.g., 960px wide).
Limit user input to a maximum of 100 squares per side to prevent excessive resource usage and potential performance issues.
Ensure that entering a new value, such as 64, results in a new 64x64 grid without altering the total pixel count.

Extra Credit:
Enhance the mouse interaction behavior by implementing additional modifications for each square.
-Randomize the RGB values of the squares with each interaction to introduce color variation throughout the grid.
-Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%, aiming for complete blackness after ten interactions.
